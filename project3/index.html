    <p>On October 18, 2007, Steven Molaro was experimenting with the Domino's pizza-ordering website, specifically testing the accuracy of ordering pizza toppings on the "left" versus "right", as seen when opening the box. Using the site's radio buttons, he ordered two pizzas. The first, with pepperoni on the left and mushrooms on the right, arrived correctly partitioned, though reversed from the specific left-right orientation he had ordered. The second was a six-inch (150 mm) pizza with no sauce, no cheese, and beef only on the left side of the pizza; while correctly absent of the typical base elements, Molaro said, "the whole pizza was so small and light it must have shifted during delivery. And the little beef pellets didn't have any sauce or cheese to hang on to, so a few lost their footing from the left half." Molaro described the second pizza itself as "tasteless bread with salty meat pellets", though his wife did eat it, an act he supposed testified to some level of quality and edibleness. On October 19, he published a comedic post about the experiment on his blog, The Sneeze, where he named his beefy flatbread "NONE Pizza with Left Beef". When trying to explain his rationale many years later, Molaro compared it to "when kids get a toy, they play with it for awhile and then start messing around with it in other weird ways." Ordering pizza online was a novel experience, and he sought to push the limits of what it would allow.</p>

    <p>The film has sparked boisterous reactions and disorderly conduct from viewers, particularly American and British adolescent boys, with some partaking in a viral Internet phenomenon on TikTok, alongside other social media platforms. Participants would often react enthusiastically to moments in the film that have been the subject of Internet memes, such as spontaneously erupting into loud cheers, jumping in excitement, dancing, or throwing popcorn when Black's character exclaims, "Chicken jockey!" Other viral lines include "Flint and steel!" and "I... am Steve", though neither approached the frenzy surrounding "Chicken jockey!" In one screening, viral videos emerged documenting audience members hoisting a live chicken after the quote and promptly ejected from the theater in Provo, Utah; another involved a group setting off fire extinguishers and smoke bombs, suffocating fellow theatergoers; while another led to a violent altercation in the parking lot outside the theater after adults asked four teenagers to quiet down. The trend has also spread to Australia and South Africa.</p>

    <p>How to Make Sushi is webcomic by Spanish cartoonist Molg H. that seeming begins as a do-it-yourself illustration on how to make sushi rolls at home but ends up with the character having an emotional meltdown in a fetal position after failing to keep the roll together as instructed. Since its emergence in May 2016, the webcomic has become an exploitable, and spawned a series of parodies featuring well-known characters from various fictional franchises. On May 1st, 2016, Spanish illustrator Molg H. posted the original comic to his Twitter and Facebook pages. Within the first nine months, the Facebook post gained more than 43,000 likes and 23,000 shares, while the tweet racked up over 3,300 retweets and 2,600 likes. On May 11th, Redditor WistfulEccentricity submitted an English-translated version of the comic to the /r/funny subreddit, where the post gained 1,243 points (82% upvoted) prior to being archived.</p>
